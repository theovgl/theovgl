## Hi there 👋

My name is Théo Vogel, I'm a developer based in France.

I'm really passionate about web development. I'm mostly proficient in front-end (React, Next.js, Svelte) but I'm really excited to learn more about back-end too!

🌱 I’m currently having a lot of fun learning Go! I was feeling rusty and I missed back-end areas, it was time to do something about it!

📫 Feel free to reach me on [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/theo-vogel), [Mastodon](https://piaille.fr/@theovgl) or by email contact[at]theovogel[dot]fr
